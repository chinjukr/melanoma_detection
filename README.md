## General Information

This project focuses on developing a CNN model for accurately detecting melanoma, a type of skin cancer that is responsible for 75% of skin cancer-related deaths. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and management of melanoma.
- This project focuses on developing a CNN model for accurately detecting melanoma, a type of skin cancer that is responsible for 75% of skin cancer-related deaths. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and management of melanoma.

The project utilizes a dataset consisting of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases obtained from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). The dataset is divided into nine classes of skin diseases, including actinic keratosis, basal cell carcinoma, dermatofibroma, melanoma, nevus, pigmented benign keratosis, seborrheic keratosis, squamous cell carcinoma, and vascular lesion.

The business problem that this project aims to address is the need for an automated system that can accurately detect melanoma and alert dermatologists about its presence. This can reduce the manual effort and time required for diagnosis, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes.
